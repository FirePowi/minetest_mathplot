# minetest_mathplot

A creative-mode minetest mod that provides tools for constructing mathematical curves/surfaces/solids. It is built with the intention of being used as an educational tool in a multivariable / vector calculus course.

## Usage

(More information coming Real Soon Now.)

After enabling the mathplot mod in the world configuration menu, search "mathplot" in the inventory screen to find the "MathPlot Origin Node" (white background with picture of xyz-coordinate axes). After placing an Origin node and attempting to dig it, a menu with various options displays; see the "Examples" screen for some pre-defined curves/surfaces/solids!

To destroy an Origin node, dig it using the "MathPlot Origin Node Destroyer" tool.  It looks like a a set of coordinate axes with a circle and line through it.
